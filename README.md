# N-gram Text Generator

You'll build a n-gram model and use it to generate text. You'll use three
public-domain books (from Project Gutenberg) to train the n-gram model:

- _The Great Gatsby_ by F. Scott Fitzgerald
- _Pride and Prejudice_ by Jane Austen
- _The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes_ by Arthur Conan Doyle
